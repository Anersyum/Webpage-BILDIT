                    When it comes to games I love RPGs, JRPGs in particular. My favourite game to date is Persona 4
                    Golden
                    because it resembles an anime, and I love anime. You're a student by day and fight demons by night,
                    how cool is that?
                </p>
                <p class="chronoDesc">
                    Chrono Trigger is my second favourite game. Time travel is done so good in this game as well as
                    the combat system. The story is also really good and the fact that it has multiple endings gets
                    you to play through it multiple times.
                </p>
                <p class="finalDesc">
                    Also one of my favourites is Final Fantasy 6. In fact, I love the whole Final Fantasy franchise.
                    Final Fantasy 6 has a memorable villian named Kefka. Without giving anything away in the story,
                    I'll just say that the story is great, as are the characters!
