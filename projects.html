            Most projects that I made started more as something I wanted to experiment with.
            I tried to experiment with different technologies using them in different projects. For example,
            I learned Ruby beacuse I wanted to try RPG Maker VX Ace. Learned basic C# so I could do unity.
            Ofcourse there are projects that I've done as part of BILD-IT. Those were written in Java.
            Here is a list of some projects (as well as their description and how far I've gotten with them):
